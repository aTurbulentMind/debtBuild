The preliminary market canvas boils down the long list of software vendors to just the top candidates which may suit agency operations. Analysis of software features can be time consuming, you have the ability to choose based on "best fit", look and feel. Check out product literature, websites, industry sources (trade magazines, trade conferences) and the recommendations from industry associates to narrow the list to a workable size.\r

Examine in depth the software features of the top candidates to ensure that agency requirements are met. Make a list of required features, or use our Debt Collection Software Evaluation Checklist to help you track the capabilities of each collection system. Acquire demonstration software and do evaluation walk-thrus to determine if the software works the way the agency requires; and that there are competent staff members of the software company to support the agency.\r

Having collection software with all the features the agency needs is not enough. It is important to research the competency, industry experience and business practices of the software vendor. Ascertain the company size, length of time in business, market share and industry presence. Inquire into their business practices for bug fixes, problem resolution and product advancement. Training, custom programming, technical support and emergency services are vital factors to maintaining the health of a collection agency.\r
